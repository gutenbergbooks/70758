  <h2 class="nobreak" id="chief">I.</h2>

  <p><span class="smcap">Any</span> one who would take the trouble on going to a strange city, to
    examine the rubbish in its suburbs and streets, and carefully collect
    and compare the fragments of pottery, pieces of cloth, of paper,
    cordage, the bones of different animals used as food, worked pieces of
    stone, wood, bone, or metal, might gain some insight into the modes of
    life of the inhabitants, and form a fair conception of the progress
    they had made in the arts of civilization. Even after a city has become
    a ruin, and centuries have passed by, such examinations have been
    attended with fruitful results. A savage tribe, dwelling for a long
    period on one and the same place, would inevitably leave vestiges of
    the manner in which they lived, though these would, of course, be fewer
    in kinds just in proportion as the people were nearer to a primeval
    condition.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

  <p>The former dwelling-places of the Aborigines of the United States are
    nowhere more plainly indicated than along the seaboard, where some
    of the tribes passed a portion, at least, of each year, in hunting
    and fishing; some no doubt living there permanently, while others, it
    appears, made visits only at stated periods.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The clam, the quahog,
    the scallop, and the oyster, entered largely into their food, and the
    castaway shells of these, piled up during many years, have not only
    become monuments of their sea-shore life, but have largely aided in the
    preservation of the bones of the animals on which they fed, and also of
    some of the more perishable implements used in their rude arts.</p>

  <p>The shell-heaps on the Atlantic coast long since attracted notice.
    Dr. C. T. Jackson, and afterwards Professor Chadbourne, visited the
    remarkable one at Damariscotta, in Maine; Sir Charles Lyell has
    particularly described another on St. Simon’s Island, in Georgia,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
    and quite recently Mr. Charles Rau, of New York, has given a full and
    instructive account of the examination of another at Keyport, New
    Jersey.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> We have ourselves examined two on the sea-coast of East
    Florida, and still others in considerable numbers on the banks of the
    upper St. John’s, in the same State. These last-mentioned heaps consist
    wholly of the shells of fresh-water species. We may have something
    to say of them hereafter, but at present shall only speak of such as
    were visited on the coast of Maine and Massachusetts during the summer
    and autumn of the year just passed. Of the localities where these are
    situated, and of the structure of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>heaps, we shall speak as briefly
    as possible; but shall enter somewhat fully into details, in connection
    with the implements and the remains of animals found in them. It is to
    be understood, however, that the heaps here described are only a very
    small portion of those to be seen along the coast of these two States,
    and which offer an ample reward to any who will take the trouble to
    examine them.</p>

  <h2>II.</h2>

  <p><i>Frenchman’s Bay.</i> Mount Desert is the largest of the islands on
    the indented coast of Maine, and forms the western shore of Frenchman’s
    Bay. Many shell-heaps are scattered over this and the adjoining islands
    and the main land. Williamson,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> without particularly designating
    them, mentions the existence of several from one to two acres in
    extent, and states that “a heavy growth of trees was found upon them
    by the first settlers.” We have examined two. The first of these is in
    Gouldsboro’, on the main land, and near the water’s edge on the eastern
    shore of the bay. It is said to cover an acre of land, but being under
    cultivation was examined only near its border, where a pit was sunk
    showing a deposit of clamshells about two feet in thickness. Among
    these were found the bones of several animals, including those of the
    deer, elk, and beaver, but no implements of any kind. Stone implements
    have, however, been found by those who have cultivated the soil of this
    neighborhood.</p>

  <p>A more complete examination was made of a second deposit on one of two
    small islands, neither of which are named, about a mile west of the
    place just mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>This heap is seen on a bank, at a height of
    about six feet above the high-water mark, varies in thickness from
    a few inches to about three feet, and extends along the shore about
    two hundred and fifty feet, and from thirty to forty feet inland. A
    section through the heap at its thickest part showed that it belonged
    to two different periods, indicated by two distinct layers of shells.
    The lowest, a foot in thickness, consisted of the shells of the clam,
    whelk, and mussel, all much decomposed, and mixed with earth. Above
    this was a layer of dark vegetable mould, mixed with earth and gravel,
    and from six to eight inches in thickness. Above this was a second
    layer of shells, of the same species as those just mentioned, but in a
    much better state of preservation, and with less intermixture of earth;
    this deposit was in turn covered by another layer of earth and mould,
    and these now sustain a growth of forest trees, but none of them of
    large size. From the state of things just described, it would seem that
    the place had been reoccupied, after having been once abandoned long
    enough for a vegetable mould to be formed, and a layer of earth from
    some neighboring source to be deposited over it. Charcoal was found in
    considerable quantity, scattered among the shells, and the remains of
    an old fireplace were uncovered. The bones of animals, and the various
    kinds of implements (<a href="#pl14">Pl. 14</a>, figs. 3, 4, 5; <a href="#pl15">Pl. 15</a>, figs. 10, 11)
    obtained during the excavations, will be described in another page.</p>

  <h2>III.</h2>

  <p><i>Crouch’s Cove.</i> This is situated on Goose Island, in Casco Bay,
    about fifteen miles north-east of Portland. The whole island is at
    present covered with a growth of spruce trees (<i>Abies nigra</i>),
    excepting a narrow strip on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> the seaward side, and on this, at the
    southerly end of the island, are several shell-heaps of different
    sizes. The longest of these is about one hundred and fifty feet in
    length, forty in width, and varying in thickness from a few inches to
    nearly three feet. Considerable portions have been washed away, and the
    contents scattered along the shore. The shells are mostly deposited
    evenly, but here and there are raised into small knolls, and all are
    covered with turf. This deposit has been carefully examined by Mr. C.
    B. Fuller, of Portland, by whom large collections have been made, and
    a portion of which were unfortunately destroyed by the great fire of
    1866. Mr. Edward S. Morse has more recently made a partial examination,
    and obtained many valuable specimens, which will be mentioned farther
    on.</p>

  <p>Our examinations<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> were begun on the bank and carried inland, until
    about 375 square feet of surface, and more than 700 cubic feet of
    material had been moved. Mr. Morse has given the following account of
    the shells found in this, and some of the smaller deposits near by. He
    enumerates the following species: “Common Clam (<i>Mya arenaria</i>),
    Quahog (<i>Venus mercenaria</i>), Large Scallop (<i>Pecten
    tenuicostatus</i>), Large Mussel (<i>Mytilus modiolus</i>), Cockle
    (<i>Purpura lapillus</i>), Beach Snail (<i>Natica heros</i>), Whelk
    (<i>Buccinum undatum</i>), Periwinkle (<i>Littorina litoralis</i>);
    and also the following, for which there are no common names: <i>Nassa
    obsoleta</i>, <i>Natica triseriata</i>, and <i>Macoma fusca</i>. The
    following land snails were also met with: <i>Helix albolabris</i>,
    <i>Sayii</i>, <i>alternata</i>, <i>lineata</i>, <i>striatella</i>,
    <i>indentata</i>, <i>multidentata</i>, <i>Zua lubricoides</i>, and
    <i>Succinea Totteniana</i>.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

  <p>“The heaps were almost entirely composed of the shells of the common
    clam, which appeared longer and rougher in texture than that now dug
    near by. In some of the heaps the shells of the quahog were abundant,
    and marked for their size and solidity. This species, though no longer
    found in the same cove with the heaps, may be had in the neighborhood
    of Goose Island, but localities in which it lives are quite rare north
    of Cape Cod. The common mussel, whelk, cockle, and scallop, were
    probably used as food, while the other species were doubtless carried
    there by accident. The presence of so many species of land snails would
    seem to indicate that the island was once covered with hard-wood trees,
    among which these animals alone flourish. The occurrence of the little
    snail, <i>Zua lubricoides</i>, is inconsistent with the view that it is
    an introduced species.”</p>

  <p>The shells were deposited in two different layers, very much as on the
    island in Frenchman’s Bay already described. The older was separated
    from the more recent deposit by a thin stratum of earth, extending
    through the largest portion of the heaps. Pieces of charcoal were
    scattered everywhere among the shells, but in some places the larger
    quantity and the blackened earth showed where fires had been made. The
    number of the fragments of the bones of edible animals was quite large,
    belonging to no less than fifteen species. Besides these, many bones of
    other species, bone implements (<a href="#pl14">Pl. 14</a>, figs. 1, 2; <a href="#pl15">Pl. 15</a>, figs. 6, 7,
    8, 9, 12, 13), and pieces of bone from which portions had been sawed
    off were found; no implements of stone were exhumed, though Mr. Swan
    found a small pestle, and Mr. Morse a chisel lying on the surface near
    the shore.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

  <h2>IV.</h2>

  <p>A third deposit was examined at <i>Eagle Hill</i>, in Ipswich,
    Massachusetts, situated on the borders of a creek, by which easy access
    is had to the sea-shore. The whole neighboring region consists of a
    series of low hills of gravel, some of them covered with boulders, but
    entirely destitute of forest trees. A few basswood trees (<i>Tilia
    Americana</i>) have been known to exist there within a few years, but
    otherwise those hills do not appear to have been wooded within the
    memory or traditions of the present inhabitants. Several shell-heaps
    are reported to exist in the neighborhood, but the only one examined
    was on the easterly side of the hill mentioned above. This consists
    of several disconnected deposits of shells, which are in part spread
    out into a uniform layer, but in a few instances form small knolls
    from eight to ten feet in diameter. Near the water’s edge the shells
    are exposed by the washing away of the bank, but elsewhere are covered
    with mould and turf, and, in some places, even on the knolls, with a
    layer of gravel. In the more even portions, this last may have been
    washed down from the slopes above, but such could not have been the
    case with the knolls, for the tendency would have been to denudation
    rather than to covering up. The shells, forming these deposits, are
    almost exclusively those of the common clam, which are still found
    here in great quantities, and yield a considerable revenue to those
    engaged in digging them. Large piles of recently dug shells may be
    seen along the neighboring shore, and noticeably contrast with those
    from the Indian shell-heaps, in being thinner and less rough in their
    texture. Shells of the oyster and the Mactra were found, but few in
    number. Somewhat extensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> excavations<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> yielded bones of the deer,
    beaver, dog, birds, among these the bones of the turkey, and of fish;
    but only a single implement of stone, which was spherical in shape,
    with a groove around the middle of it. This was found by Mr. Putnam
    just beneath the surface. Some of the bones showed distinct marks of
    cutting instruments, and a few pieces of wrought bone were found, three
    of which are represented in <a href="#pl15">Pl. 15</a>, figs. 15, 16, 17. Two distinct
    fireplaces, indicated by hard-wood charcoal, ashes and blackened earth,
    were discovered resting on the earth and beneath the shells.</p>

  <h2>V.</h2>

  <p>In the town of <i>Salisbury</i>, Massachusetts, a series of heaps
    thirteen in all, quite near together, consisted exclusively of the
    shell of the clam. They are about a mile from the left bank of the
    Merrimack River, near its mouth, and surrounded by a series of
    sand-downs, some wooded, others naked; these last constantly changing
    from the action of the wind. They vary in size from about twenty to
    more than one hundred feet in diameter, but the shells form a layer of
    only a few inches, and are largely mixed with sand. After a careful
    search, in company with Mr. Alfred Osgood, of Newburyport, we failed to
    find in most of them any of the works of man, except only a few flakes
    or “chips” of flint; but on two, both near together, large quantities
    of chips were scattered over the surface, and more than five pounds
    were picked up. Besides these, several arrow-heads and fragments of
    pots, made of burned clay mixed with coarse sand, were found. No bones
    of animals, which might have served for food, were noticed, though
    carefully looked for. In previous years, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>large numbers of stone
    implements of various kinds have been carried away; but as the place is
    in the neighborhood of a large town, and is frequently visited by those
    in search of such relics, they are now nearly exhausted.</p>

  <h2>VI.</h2>

  <p><i>Cotuit Port</i> is in the town of Barnstable, on the south side of
    Cape Cod, and on the northern shore of a narrow bay. It is quite near
    to the sea, but protected from it by a narrow spit of land, which forms
    a natural breakwater across the bay at its mouth. Within the distance
    of a few miles, a large number of shell-heaps are met with, and have
    been estimated to cover hundreds of acres, sometimes having a thickness
    of between one and two feet, and at others of only a few inches.
    Oysters were formerly found in the bay in much larger quantities
    than at present, and doubtless formed one of the chief attractions
    which drew the Indians to this place. Our examinations were confined
    chiefly to one of the larger deposits, about a mile to the eastward of
    the village, situated on a sloping surface with a pleasant southerly
    exposure. Excavations by four persons during a whole day were made
    near the shore, and at various points inland, and brought to light the
    shells of the oyster, clam, scallop, and quahog, in large numbers, but
    quite unequally distributed; the clam being plentiful in some places,
    the quahog in others, and the scallop in others, while the oyster
    abounded everywhere.</p>

  <p>Two species of <i>Pyrula</i>, viz.: <i>P. carica</i> and <i>P.
    canaliculata</i> were found, the first in considerable numbers. Neither
    of these species was found in any of the other heaps. Dr. Gould states
    that they are not known to exist north of Cape Cod. The largest
    specimen of the <i>P.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> carica</i> was about seven inches in length, a
    portion of the spire having been broken off, and this, according to
    Dr. Gould, is their maximum size on the Coast of Massachusetts. It
    is, however, in remarkable contrast with a shell of the same species
    from one of the shell-heaps in Florida, which measured nearly fourteen
    inches in length.</p>

  <p>Of the remains of vertebrates, the bones of the deer were the most
    abundant; but those of the seal, the fox, the mink, of birds, including
    those of a duck and the wild turkey, of turtle and of fish were found.
    During a former examination of this locality by Mr. George G. Lowell
    and Dr. Algernon Coolidge, a canine of a bear and a part of the skull
    of a cat was obtained. No stone implements, but a few worked pieces
    of bone were dug up, and also some fragments from which portions had
    been sawed off. The tine of a deer’s antler, from which the tip had
    been sawed off, is represented on <a href="#pl15">Pl. 15</a>, fig. 14. About two-thirds of
    the metatarsal bone of the great toe from a human foot was found, in
    company with the bones of the animals already mentioned, and is the
    only portion of the skeleton of man which we have discovered while
    examining the heaps here described. The writer would express his
    obligations to Mr. George G. Lowell for the opportunity of examining
    the locality at Cotuit Port, and for the gift of valuable specimens.</p>

  <h2>VII.</h2>

  <p><i>Age.</i> Shell-heaps have become intimately associated with the
    question of the age of the human race, a question which has passed
    out of the domain of the written, into that of geological history.
    It can only be satisfactorily answered by following the method of
    the geologist, when he attempts to determine the period when a given
    animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> existed in former geological times, viz., by a careful
    comparison of the remains of such animal with those of existing
    species, and by an accurate study of the geological and other physical
    conditions under which they are found. In Denmark, such methods applied
    to the <i>Kjœkkenmœddings</i>, or refuse-heaps, have yielded results
    of great importance to archæology, and have shown that some of these
    heaps at least, as in Seeland along the Isefjord, date back to a period
    when their geological surroundings were somewhat different from what
    they now are, when the shores were less raised above the sea, and the
    oysters, of the shells of which the heaps are made up, had not yet
    retreated to where the fresher waters of the Baltic, at the present
    time, mingle with those of the ocean in the Kategatt.</p>

  <p>The shell-heaps we have here described yield nothing which indicates
    as high an antiquity as those of the old world. The materials of them
    present some variety in the degree of decomposition which has resulted
    from time and exposure, the lower layers being much more disintegrated
    and friable, the shells in fact falling to pieces, while those of the
    upper ones generally preserve their original firmness. That there was
    a difference in time in which these layers were deposited, is further
    indicated by the fact, that, in two of the heaps, a stratum of earth is
    interposed between the earlier and later deposits, as if the locality
    had been abandoned as a camping place, and then after a prolonged
    absence of the natives had been reoccupied. Each heap, too, is covered
    with a deposit of earth and vegetable mould, of variable thickness, and
    in some cases, as at Frenchman’s Bay, supporting a growth of forest
    trees, though these were nowhere of such size as to indicate that they
    had lived a century. Mr. Morse has called attention to the abundance of
    <i>Helices</i>, or land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> snails, which were exhumed at Crouch’s Cove,
    and to the fact that these require a hard-wood growth for subsistence,
    while at present the island, on which this cove is situated, is covered
    with spruces. It is also noticeable that there has been in all the
    localities, except at Salisbury, a disintegration of the shores, the
    sea undermining and destroying the deposits. There can be no doubt that
    these were once much more extensive than now, and that the water has
    worked its way into their places. Lastly, these deposits contain the
    remains of animals, as of the elk, not known at present to exist to the
    eastward of the Alleghany Mountains; of the wild turkey, now virtually
    extinct in New England; and of the great auk, which, unless it still
    live on some of the small islands to the north of Newfoundland, has
    receded almost, if not quite, to the arctic regions.</p>

  <p>All these circumstances are certainly signs of the lapse of time.
    Nevertheless, in the absence of any positive data as to how long a
    period is necessary for the accumulation of vegetable mould, or for the
    washing of earth from the slopes above on to the heaps below, or for
    the rate of decomposition of shells in a given time, or of the rate
    of the denudations of the shores; and in view, too, of the fact that
    the animals represented in the heaps, but now no longer met with in
    the regions of them, have all disappeared within the historic period
    of this continent, it will be readily admitted that proof of great age
    or “high antiquity” is not found in any or all the circumstances which
    have been mentioned above.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, it may be safely said that there is nothing in the
    condition of these heaps which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that
    they were begun many centuries ago. The examinations at Crouch’s Cove,
    Eagle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> Hill, and Cotuit Port were sufficiently extended to enable us
    to obtain a fair representation of the objects they contain; but in
    no case was there found, nor have we been able to learn, that there
    had been previously found a single article which could be regarded
    as having been made by, or derived from the white man, nor did we
    obtain any evidence that these particular heaps had been materially
    added to since the European has occupied these shores. Had intercourse
    with Europeans been once fairly established, it were a reasonable
    presumption that we should have found at least a glass bead, a fragment
    of earthenware, or an instrument of some sort indicative of the fact,
    especially when we bear in mind that it would be in just such places,
    where the savages collected around their fires and seething-pots to
    cook and eat, that such objects might be expected to be broken or lost.
    Finally, if the statements of Williamson on the authority of Johnson be
    correct, viz., that “a heavy growth of trees was found on them” (the
    deposits of clam-shells near Mount Desert) “by the first settlers,” we
    have something like satisfactory evidence that their age could not have
    been less than between three or four centuries.</p>

  <h2>VIII.</h2>

  <p><i>Remains of Animals.</i> Human remains have not been found in the
    shell-heaps of Denmark, except in the case of casual burials, as of a
    shipwrecked sailor, or of burials from some other unusual occurrence,
    and these are of a modern date. The same absence of human remains marks
    the shell-heaps we are describing, with a single exception. At Cotuit
    Port an unequivocal metatarsal bone from the great toe of the human
    foot was discovered. No other bones were found with it, except those of
    animals. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> was so deeply buried, and its appearance was such, that
    no doubt exists that it was of the same age as the heap itself; we
    have therefore assigned it a place in the following table, which gives
    a list of the species of animals uncovered and identified by their
    bones, or shells, in the different heaps, and shows their relative
    distribution through them.</p>

  <p>Besides the species of shells mentioned above, and which may be
    regarded as having been used for food,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> there were also found
    species from the following genera, probably accidentally introduced,
    viz.: <i>Tritonium</i>, <i>Littorina</i>, <i>Nassa Zua</i> and
    <i>Purpura</i>; seven species of <i>Helix</i>; three species of
    <i>Natica</i>.</p>

  <p>A glance at the above table shows what a great variety of animals was
    brought to these places by the Indians. Some were hunted as articles of
    food, others for their skin, and still others for both. Precisely where
    the line is to be drawn between those which are and are not edible, or
    what animal an Indian would absolutely refuse to eat, it is impossible
    to say. Although the kinds of meat used were in the main palatable, the
    natives certainly did not hesitate to make use of some which do not
    commend themselves to the taste of civilized people. Josselyn, who, of
    all the earlier writers, has given the most complete account of the
    animals found on the coast of New England, states that “the Indians,
    when weary with travelling, will take them (the rattlesnakes) up with
    their bare hands, laying hold with one hand behind their head, with the
    other taking hold of their tail, and with their teeth tear off the skin
    of their backs, and feed upon them alive, which, they say, refresheth
    them.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>The bones of the deer and birds outnumber those of all the other kinds.
    The condition in which they are found bears a striking resemblance
    to that of the bones from the shell-heaps of Scotland, the Orkneys,
    and Denmark. Nearly all the fragments from the <i>deer</i> were those
    of the long bones, which in the living animal are either covered by
    the largest amount of flesh, or contain the most marrow. Not one of
    them was whole, all having been broken up for the double purpose of
    extracting the marrow, a custom almost world wide among savages, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>often practised by hunters, and of accommodating them to the size of
    the vessel in which they were cooked. Even the phalanges of the toes
    were treated in the same way.</p>

  <p>The bones of the <i>bear</i>, though much less numerous, were similarly
    broken up, and in two instances had been carbonized by contact with
    the fire. Among the specimens collected by Mr. Morse in his first
    visit to Crouch’s Cove, was the last molar from the lower jaw. The
    crown was somewhat worn, but the ridges were not all effaced; it was
    of small size, measuring 0.55 inch in length, and 0.46 in breadth. The
    average size of eight specimens of the same molar in the black bear
    was, length 0.60 inch, breadth 0.47, while that of two specimens from
    the polar bear was, length 0.54 inch, breadth 0.45. The tooth from the
    shell-heaps, therefore, as regards size, more closely resembles the
    last-mentioned species, as it does also in the shape of the crown,—but
    it would be unsafe, from a single specimen of the molar in question,
    to attempt to identify them. The former existence of the polar bear,
    on the coast of Maine, is rendered quite probable by the fact that the
    tusk of a walrus has actually been found at Gardiner.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Sir Charles
    Lyell obtained a portion of the cranium of another at Gay Head,
    Martha’s Vineyard.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It was found by a fisherman who supposed that
    it had fallen from a cretaceous bed in the cliff above. Perhaps it may
    have been of a more recent date, and a contemporary of the Great Auk.</p>

  <p>The presence of the bones of the <i>dog</i> might be accounted for on
    the score of its being a domesticated animal, but the fact that they
    were not only found mingled with those of the edible kinds, but like
    them were broken up, suggests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> the probability of their having been
    used as food. We have not seen it mentioned, however, by any of the
    earlier writers, that such was the case along the coast, though it
    appears to have been otherwise with regard to some of the interior
    tribes as the Hurons. With them, game being scarce, “venison was a
    luxury found only at feasts, and dog flesh was in high esteem.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> We
    have not found any marks of cutting instruments, as was the case with
    the bones found by Steenstrup in the shell-heaps of Denmark, and from
    which circumstance he inferred that dogs were eaten. In fact, they have
    served as food in so many parts of the world, that the use of their
    flesh anywhere ought not to be considered an improbability.</p>

  <p>A whole left half of the lower jaw of a <i>wolf</i> was found at Mount
    Desert, measuring 7.5 inches in length, making a strong contrast in
    size, with a similar half from a dog found at Crouch’s Cove. This was
    more curved, and had a length of a little less than five inches.</p>

  <p>The bones of <i>birds</i>, like those of the deer, were almost without
    exception broken, but in quite a different manner. In the latter it was
    the shaft that was shattered, the ends often remaining uninjured; while
    in the birds the shaft was whole, and the ends not only broken off, but
    nowhere to be found. It is not to be supposed that they were so broken
    off for the extraction of the marrow, since those containing only air
    were treated in the same way. Steenstrup having observed the same fact
    in the remains from the Danish shell-heaps, suspected that they were
    mutilated by dogs, and accordingly by way of experiment, having kept
    some of these animals on short diet, gave them various bird bones to
    eat. He found, as he had anticipated, that they ate the ends, rejecting
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>shaft. He explains their choice by the greater sponginess, and
    easier digestibility of the former as compared with the dense middle
    portion of the latter. No doubt an additional inducement was found in
    the remains of flesh, tendon, and ligament, which would usually remain
    adherent to the ends, after the portions ordinarily eaten had been
    removed. On looking over the specimens of our collections, marks of
    teeth of animals were frequently noticed, some of them of such size as
    might be made by dogs, but others by a much smaller animal, as a cat or
    mink.</p>

  <p>Of the remains of birds, by far the most interesting are those of the
    Great Auk (<i>Alca impennis</i>), which formerly had a much wider
    geographical distribution than now, for having followed the glaciers in
    their retreat, at present it is confined to the arctic and subarctic
    regions. In Europe it formerly existed, as appears from the evidence
    of the shell-heaps, on the shores of Scotland, the Orkneys, and it
    has recently died out in Iceland. In the United States we have the
    authority of Steenstrup and Prof. Baird for its former existence as
    far south as Cape Cod. There can be but little doubt that the last
    survivors lingered till after the arrival of the Europeans. The
    description of the “Wobble,” by Josslyn, as far as it goes, applies
    to the Great Auk, “an ill-shaped bird, having no long feathers in
    their pinions which is the reason they cannot fly; not much unlike a
    penguin.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>There are various traditions along the sea-coast of its having been
    seen at a much later date. Audubon, however, in his voyage to Labrador
    saw none in the Straits of Belle Isle, but was told that they still
    bred on an island north of Newfoundland.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

  <p>The remains of the Great Auk in the shell-heaps of Maine, were in
    sufficient numbers to show that it must have been common, since
    seven specimens of the humerus alone were found, besides fragments
    of the cranium, jaws, and sternum. The specimens of humerus differed
    remarkably in condition from the same bone of other birds found with
    them, in not being mutilated; for of the seven specimens, four were
    whole, and the fifth had lost but one end, while of the humeri of the
    other kinds, scarce one was whole enough to enable one to identify
    the species. They seem not to have been attractive to the dogs.
    They are characterized by their much flattened shape, thick walls,
    narrow cavity, and the absence of an opening for the entrance of air.
    Well-preserved specimens of the coracoid bone were also found entire.</p>

  <p>The catalogue we have given of the animals found in the shell-heaps
    shows that the elements of variety in food certainly existed,
    especially if we add to these the maize, beans, squashes, and various
    kinds of roots Indians are known to have used. From the testimony
    of eyewitnesses, soon after the settlement of the country, it
    appears that while sometimes the Indian contented himself with maize
    roasted, or with this and beans made into a pottage, he often, when
    the necessary materials were at hand, made what might well be called a
    hodge-podge. Gookin gives a full account of the manner in which this
    was concocted. In a word, it consisted of a mixture of fish and flesh
    of all sorts. “Shad, eels, alewives,” “venison, beaver, bear’s flesh,
    moose, otters, raccoons, or any kind that they take in hunting,” are
    cut into pieces, bones and all, and stewed together. “Also they mix
    with said pottage several sorts of roots, as Jerusalem artichokes, and
    ground nuts, and other roots, and pompions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> squashes, and also
    several sorts of nuts or masts, as oak-acorns, chestnuts, walnuts.
    These, husked and dried and powdered, they thicken their pottage
    therewith.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>Father Rasles<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> expresses his disgust at their style of cooking and
    eating, and Wood evidently had a poor stomach for “their unoat-mealed
    broth, made thick with fishes, fowles, and beasts, boyled all together,
    some remaining raw, the rest converted by overmuch seething to a
    loathed mash, not half so good as Irish boniclapper.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> When visiting
    the English, if offered food, Wood informs us they ate but little, “but
    at home they will eat till their bellies stand forth ready to split
    with fullness.”<a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

  <p><i>Works of Art.</i> <i>Pottery</i> is poorly represented, only small
    fragments having been found. Like those from other parts of the United
    States, the pots were made of clay, with or without the admixture of
    pounded shells, and were imperfectly burned so that the walls are both
    friable and porous. The ornamentation, when it exists, is of the rudest
    kind (<a href="#pl14">Pl. 14</a>, fig. 18), consisting of indentations or tracings with a
    single point, or, as in some cases, with a series of points on one and
    the same instrument. Both at Crouch’s Cove and Cotuit Port, specimens
    were found in which the lines in the surface had been formed by
    impressing an evenly twisted cord into the soft clay (<a href="#pl14">Pl. 14</a>, fig. 19),
    the cord being laid on in various positions. This kind of ornamentation
    has a special interest, since there is evidence of its having been made
    use of in widely distant places. We have found similar specimens on the
    banks of the St. John’s in Florida; there are others from Illinois,
    presented to the Peabody Museum by J. P. Pearson, Esq., of Newburyport,
    and others have been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>noticed in the ancient barrows of England.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
    This kind of ornament has given rise to the belief that the pots were
    moulded in nets, which were removed after the vessel was finished. All
    the specimens we have seen are wanting in any indication of a regular
    mesh, or of the existence of knots where the cords crossed, which, if
    they existed, as they must have in a net, could not have failed to be
    represented.</p>

  <p><i>Implements.</i> It is somewhat remarkable that with the exception of
    the shell-heaps at Salisbury, all of those here described yielded so
    few articles made of stone. At Mount Desert only two arrow-heads were
    found, at Crouch’s Cove Mr. Swann found a pestle, and Mr. Morse a rude
    chisel, both picked up on the shore, but probably washed out from among
    the shells. At Eagle Hill, Mr. Putnam found a spherical stone with a
    groove around it, but at Cotuit Port not a single piece of worked stone
    was discovered. In regions adjoining the different shell deposits,
    especially at Cotuit Port, an abundance of stone implements have been
    found, and those who have preceded us have occasionally obtained some
    from the heaps. In the Danish heaps, they seem to have been quite
    common, and Mr. Rau found them so at Keyport.</p>

  <p>Implements of <i>bone</i>, on the other hand, are quite abundant, as
    were also fragments of bone showing the marks of the instruments by
    which pieces had been detached, and of such there was a considerable
    variety. Some of the bones were cut across by making a groove around
    the circumference, as one would cut a notch in a stick, and breaking
    the rest; and others, as the metatarsal bones of the elk and deer,
    were split lengthwise, by making a groove on each side nearly to the
    marrow cavity, and completing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>the division by fracture. The roughly
    striated surface of the groove, and its undulating course, indicate a
    piece of stone, and not a saw, as the instrument with which the work
    was done. We have found by experiment that this mode of working bone
    does not prove so great a labor as it might at first sight seem to be,
    and with care have succeeded in splitting in two, lengthwise, in the
    course of an hour, a piece of human ulna seven inches long, by means
    of a flint “chip” held in the hand. This, of course, involves a large
    expenditure of time, but it must be remembered that an Indian’s time
    was not valued. The work is rendered very much easier by keeping both
    the instrument and bone wet. It has been objected to the opinion, that
    certain implements from the European heaps were used as saws, that
    having wedge-shaped edges they would soon become “choked” or “jammed.”
    Practically this does not happen, for we have uniformly found that the
    roughness of the sides of the flint is sufficient to widen the groove
    as fast as the edge deepens it.</p>

  <p>Implements of bone made by the Indians dwelling in New England have
    rarely been mentioned, and are seldom seen in collections, but if one
    may judge from the number of specimens we have obtained, must have
    been in quite common use. The inhabitants of the North-west Coast, and
    the Esquimaux, are largely dependent upon this material, and Messrs.
    Squier and Davis found a few bone instruments in the mounds of Ohio.
    The accompanying figures, drawn by Mr. Morse, represent the forms of
    the more important ones discovered in the different heaps, which form
    the subject of this paper. Except the first, which is reduced one-half,
    linear measurement, all are represented of the natural size. We are
    unable to assign any uses for the larger part of them, and of the
    others can only offer a conjecture.</p>

  <h2 class="small mt5">EXPLANATIONS OF PLATES 14 AND 15.</h2>

  <p>Fig. 1. This instrument is ten inches long, two inches and a half broad
    at the top, and one at the point. It is made of one of the branches of
    the antler of the moose or elk. The breadth of the upper portion is not
    seen in the figure, as the piece is represented as viewed edgewise.
    It is obliquely truncated at the lower end, so as to give it a
    chisel-shaped edge, and shows the effect of having been hacked by some
    dull tool. Attached to a handle it might be used to dig with, or might
    serve for the purpose of a head-breaker, or “casse-téte,” as described
    by Father Rasles.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> From Frenchman’s Bay.</p>

  <p>Fig. 2. A flat-pointed instrument, 3¾ inches long, and 1¼ wide. This is
    made of the dense exterior portion of an antler, and at the lower end
    has a thin sharp edge as in Fig. 2 <i>a</i>. From Crouch’s Cove.</p>

  <p>Fig. 3. A piece of one of the branches of the antler of a deer, from
    which the tip has been cut off. The sides near the pointed end have
    been worked down so as to present four faces, two of the angles uniting
    them being quite acute. The detached piece having a deep notch would
    be provided with two points or barbs, and would be adapted to serve as
    the point of an arrow. Such points were used by the aborigines, and
    we are informed by Winslow, that when the Pilgrims were making their
    first explorations on the shore at Cape Cod, previously to landing at
    Plymouth, some of the arrows shot at them had the kind of point just
    described.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> From Cotuit Port.</p>

  <p>Fig. 4. An artificially pointed fragment of bone. From Crouch’s Cove.</p>

  <p>Fig. 5. An artificially pointed fragment of bone, suitable for the
    purpose of an awl. From Crouch’s Cove.</p>

  <p>Fig. 6. A fragment of a bone of a bird, obliquely truncated and
    artificially sharpened. From Crouch’s Cove.</p>

  <p>Fig. 7. One of the lower incisors of a beaver, ground to a thin, sharp
    edge, which last is formed by the enamel on the inner, or flat side of
    the tooth. From Crouch’s Cove.</p>

  <p>Fig. 8. A well wrought and polished spindle-shaped instrument, the
    lower end of which is flattened, and has a sharp edge; the upper
    portion is rounded with the end broken off, but appears to have been
    worked to a sharp point. From Frenchman’s Bay.</p>

  <p>Fig. 9. A slender piece of bone, smoothly wrought and pointed. From
    Frenchman’s Bay.</p>

  <p>Figs. 10 and 12, from Frenchman’s Bay, and 11 and 13, from Crouch’s
    Cove, are all made of flattened pieces, each being cut from the walls
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>of one of the long bones, and showing the concellated structure on one
    of the sides.</p>

  <p>Fig. 15. From Eagle Hill; the serrated edge is quite sharp, but from
    this the bone rapidly increases to one-third of an inch in thickness,
    so as to render it wholly unsuitable to be used as a saw.</p>

  <p>Figs. 16 and 17 are flat, scraped very thin, as seen in 17 <i>a</i>;
    one of them is made from the bone of a bird. From Eagle Hill.</p>

  <p>The specimens represented by the figures just enumerated, together
    with other wrought pieces more or less mutilated, and collections of
    the bones and shells from each of the heaps, are preserved in the
    Peabody Museum of Archæology and Ethnology at Cambridge, and in the
    Ethnological Department of the Essex Institute in Salem. Of these
    specimens, those represented in Figs. 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14, were from
    the Rev. J. A. Swan; Figs. 1, 9, 12 from Mr. William A. Hayes; Figs. 2
    and 4 from Mr. Horace Mann; Figs. 10 and 17 from Mr. F. W. Putnam; Fig.
    15 from Mr. E. S. Morse, and Figs. 3, 5, 8, 10, from the writer.</p>
